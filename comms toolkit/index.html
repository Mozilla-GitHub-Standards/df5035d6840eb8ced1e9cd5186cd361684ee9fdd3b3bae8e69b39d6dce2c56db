      <p>As people learn to read, write, and participate on the web, a cross-cutting set of 21C Skills emerge as skills critical to success in today’s world. They enable individuals to become teachers, advocates, and community leaders to leverage and advance the web as an open and public resource.</p>

      <p>The 21C Skills, combined with the web literacy skills, are the nexus for entry-level digital-age skills.  They are a set of abilities such as problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, or communication that people need to develop in order to succeed in the information age.  These skills have always been critical, and even more so in an information-based economy.  When most workers held jobs in industry, the key skills were knowing a trade, following directions, getting along with others, working hard, and being professional. To hold information-age jobs, people also need to think deeply about issues, solve problems creatively, work in teams, communicate clearly in many media, learn ever-changing technologies.</p>

      <p>As part of our <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/digital-age-skills-for-educators">Digital Skills for Digital-Age Leadership Development</a> project, we have conducted research and are working closely with expert advisory groups to create a set of open badges to capture 21C skills and competencies and prototype digital badges to make learning and achievement outcomes count towards college and career readiness, and workforce development. The resulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/file/d/0B9qOTaXg3UmRaEJieEY0MkdtTFk/view">21C skills framework</a> and rubric includes a core set of skills and competencies important for leadership development that allows people and programs to customize assessments that capture 21C Skills based on relevant content.

        The following 21C Skills correspond to the specific web literacy skills indicated below.  If creativity, communication, problem-solving, and collaboration are core to leadership development, practicing these skills in an online environment is the “webby” or web-based experiences of these non-cognitive skills. These 21C Skills span across sectors and domain areas and are critical in a variety of jobs and higher education, and for success in life. As users learn and practice the web literacy skills, they also gain web-based competencies in the following 21C skills.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem-solving</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Read:</strong> Search, Navigate, Synthesize, Evaluate
          <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong> -
            Learners are problem-solving when they are able to use the web to search and critically evaluate information to synthesize findings that support a researched opinion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Write:</strong> Design, Compose, Code, Revise, Remix
          <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong> - As learners <strong>design</strong>, <strong>code</strong>, <strong>compose</strong>,
            <strong>revise</strong>, and <strong>remix</strong>, they are problem-solving when they create algorithms and
            designs that improve information sharing and services for themselves and others.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write</strong>: Design, Revise, Remix</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Participate</strong>: Share, Code, Compose, Contribute, Open Practice
          <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong> - Learners are creative when they are able to design new ways to remix and
            revise information that is accessible and approachable to broader audiences. They co-construct designs
            with with new partners that increases opportunities to share and contribute to engage more feedback.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Write</strong>: Compose, Remix</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Participate</strong> Share, Contribute, Connect, Protect, Open Practice
          <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong> - Learners are demonstrating good communication skills when they are able to use
            the web to compose and synthesize web content and remix information to share and connect effectively with others.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Participate</strong> Share, Contribute, Connect, Open Practice

        With the generous and thoughtful input by many current and emerging community members, this paper generate the latest version of Mozilla’s Web Literacy Map that includes 21C skills, leadership skills and competencieswritten in language that is approachable and accessible to more people, and connected to curriculum to make it applicable for learning and teaching web literacy skills.  If you are a general user, we suggest you identify your own skill set and level up or identify others that want to level up in an area and if you are an proficient in particular area, help them out.  If you are someone who knows how to teach others, we encourage you to find ways to embed and remix Mozilla’s open source curriculum, professional development and other resources into your offerings and share what you are doing with us and others.

          Recasting the reader as a navigator has important implications for learning and literacy. It involves making meaning online beyond traditional reading skills. (Duke &amp; Pearson, 2002; Leu, O’Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009).

          <sup id="fn2">2</sup>
            As writing moves from page to screen one of the key differences between the traditional writing process and online content construction is that individuals need to consider other elements that are particularto working with online informational text (e.g., semiotics, visual literacy, multimodal design). As the writing process moves from print to pixel, writing needs to take into account the reader/writer nature of content in a digital space. In computer science, read/write is defined as media that is capable of being displayed (read) and modified (write). In a literacy context, the reader/writer nature of online information could be viewed as a means to allow individuals to quickly and efficiently comprehend and construct online information (O’Byrne, 2014).

          Thus, the skills and competencies under the participating strand encompass the values of not only connecting with, but also protecting the values of the open web. In these activities, sharing is essential to creating the many small pieces of the web (Alexander, 2006). Individuals that excel as good participators on the open web collaborate as both a mentor and learner while sharing and creating resources in different spaces (Jenkins, 2009). By participating and connecting in these spaces, and in their specific practices, we connect as an online learning community (Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002).
