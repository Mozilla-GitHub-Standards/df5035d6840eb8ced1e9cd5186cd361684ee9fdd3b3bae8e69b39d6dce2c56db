        Below, officials and approved language to use when talking about Mozilla and our work. Have a specific style question, like whether to capitalize “Internet”? Check out Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/communications/copy-rules/">Style Guide</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mozilla</strong> -- Mozilla is a global nonprofit that believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Our work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto.
        
        <p>
          The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. We do this by connecting open Internet leaders with each other and by mobilizing grassroots activists around the world.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Foundation is also the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox and other open source tools. Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: The MoFo/MoCo distinction is mainly an internal distinction -- and one we avoid bringing up publicly, to avoid confusion. Simply use “Mozilla” in your communications whenever possible.</i>
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Internet Health</strong> -- The state of the Internet as an ecosystem. The Internet is a living entity that billions of people depend on for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression and love. As a result, the state of this system relies on -- and influences -- everyone it touches. We’re all connected.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Mozilla has identified five issues that contribute to Internet Health: Online Privacy and Security; Open Innovation; Decentralization; Digital Inclusion; and Web Literacy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Online Privacy and Security</strong> -- A healthy Internet is private and secure. Internet users should be able to have greater  choice over what information they share with what organizations and for what benefit. They  should have the freedom to express themselves online without unwarranted surveillance. And, they should be able to safeguard their information against attacks.
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Open Innovation</strong> -- A healthy Internet is open, so that together, we can innovate. People who want to change  the world should be able to build products and understand different points of view through open source code and idea sharing. Copyright and patent laws should be reformed so that in this digital age, they foster collaboration and economic opportunity.
      </p> 

      <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Open Innovation <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_openness_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/open-innovation/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Decentralization</strong> -- A healthy Internet is decentralized. There shouldn’t be online monopolies or oligopolies. Instead, big and small businesses -- and individuals from around the world -- should all be  able to contribute to and provide online services. Internet users should be able to reap the  benefits of competition and exposure to different ways of thinking.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Decentralization <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_decentralization_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Digital Inclusion</strong> -- A healthy Internet is for everyone. People -- no matter where they live in the world, their  income, their language, the color of their skin, their political affiliation, their religion, their physical ability, their sexual orientation, or their gender -- should have unfettered access  to the Internet. They should be able to both consume and create online so that the Internet  reflects the diversity of the people who use it.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Digital Inclusion <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_digital_Inclusion_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/digital-inclusion/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Web Literacy</strong> -- People everywhere should have the knowledge they need to tap into the full power of the Internet -- and to use it to make their lives and the world better. This means that everyone needs the skills to read, write and participate online. For this to happen, web literacy must be foundational in education, alongside skills like reading and math.
