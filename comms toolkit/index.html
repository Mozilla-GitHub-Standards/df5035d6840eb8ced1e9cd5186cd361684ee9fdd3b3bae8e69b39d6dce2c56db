      <p>
       Welcome to the Mozilla Foundation's Communication and Design Toolkit.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This toolkit has been developed to help Mozilla staff develop materials that are consistent and engaging. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Questions to consider when crafting communications:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>What is the goal of your activity?</li>
        <li>Who is the audience? What about this work appeals to this audience in particular?</li>
        <li>What are the best channels to reach your audience?</li>
        <li>How does this activity support the overall strategy?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Essential steps:
      </p>
      
       <ul>
        <li>Make sure to fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnJUNzJxC20BPO2U2dsVp49bHLCCmfgOREHVoxZNwIAJx0uw/viewform?c=0&w=1">communications support form</a> at least 2 weeks before your deadline</li>
        <li>Fill out a design brief if necessary</li>
        <li>Make sure you are following Mozilla brand guidelines and the Mozilla styleguide</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Below, officials and approved language to use when talking about Mozilla and our work. Have a specific style question -- like whether to capitalize “Internet”? Check out Mozilla’s Style Guide.
      </p>

      <p>
        <s>Mozilla</s> -- Mozilla is a global nonprofit that believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Our work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto.

The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. We do this by connecting open Internet leaders with each other and by mobilizing grassroots activists around the world.

The Foundation is also the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox and other open source tools. Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.

(Note: This is largely an internal distinction -- and one we avoid bringing up publicly, to avoid confusion. Simply use “Mozilla” in your communications.)
