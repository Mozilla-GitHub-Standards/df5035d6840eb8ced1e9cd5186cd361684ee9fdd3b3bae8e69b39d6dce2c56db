      <h1>MoFo Comms and Design Toolkit</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to the Mozilla Foundation's Communication and Design Toolkit.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
       In the 21st Century, everyone at an organization is a communicator and has a role in the communications strategy for engaging stakeholders--from writing and responding to emails, to updating an events calendar, to social media requests, to making the case for the impact to a potential funder. This guide is intended to hmake creating and writing clear communications a bit easier. Use this guide to: stay consistent in messaging about Mozilla; use the most up-to-date visual assets; get tips on how to know your audience and write more compelling content; and access helpful templates.
      
      <p>
        Questions to consider when using this toolkit to craft communications:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>What is the goal of your activity?</li>
        <li>Who is the audience? What about this work appeals to this audience in particular?</li>
        <li>What are the best channels to reach your audience?</li>
        <li>How does this activity support the overall strategy?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        If you're working on a larger project that requires hands-on comms support -- like blogs, press outreach or copywriting -- please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnJUNzJxC20BPO2U2dsVp49bHLCCmfgOREHVoxZNwIAJx0uw/viewform?c=0&w=1">Communications Support Form</a>

        Below, officials and approved language to use when talking about Mozilla and our work. Have a specific style question, like whether to capitalize “Internet”? Check out Mozilla’s <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/communications/copy-rules/">Style Guide</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mozilla</strong> -- Mozilla is a global nonprofit that believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Our work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto.
        
        <p>
          The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. We do this by connecting open Internet leaders with each other and by mobilizing grassroots activists around the world.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Foundation is also the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox and other open source tools. Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: The MoFo/MoCo distinction is mainly an internal distinction -- and one we avoid bringing up publicly, to avoid confusion. Simply use “Mozilla” in your communications whenever possible.</i>

      <p>
        <strong>Internet Health</strong> -- The state of the Internet as an ecosystem. The Internet is a living entity that billions of people depend on for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression and love. As a result, the state of this system relies on -- and influences -- everyone it touches. We’re all connected.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Mozilla has identified five issues that contribute to Internet Health: Online Privacy and Security; Open Innovation; Decentralization; Digital Inclusion; and Web Literacy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Online Privacy and Security</strong> -- A healthy Internet is private and secure. Internet users should be able to have greater  choice over what information they share with what organizations and for what benefit. They  should have the freedom to express themselves online without unwarranted surveillance. And, they should be able to safeguard their information against attacks.
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Open Innovation</strong> -- A healthy Internet is open, so that together, we can innovate. People who want to change  the world should be able to build products and understand different points of view through open source code and idea sharing. Copyright and patent laws should be reformed so that in this digital age, they foster collaboration and economic opportunity.
      </p> 

      <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Open Innovation <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_openness_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/open-innovation/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Decentralization</strong> -- A healthy Internet is decentralized. There shouldn’t be online monopolies or oligopolies. Instead, big and small businesses -- and individuals from around the world -- should all be  able to contribute to and provide online services. Internet users should be able to reap the  benefits of competition and exposure to different ways of thinking.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Decentralization <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_decentralization_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Digital Inclusion</strong> -- A healthy Internet is for everyone. People -- no matter where they live in the world, their  income, their language, the color of their skin, their political affiliation, their religion, their physical ability, their sexual orientation, or their gender -- should have unfettered access  to the Internet. They should be able to both consume and create online so that the Internet  reflects the diversity of the people who use it.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        <i>Need more language? Pull from the Digital Inclusion <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IHPbriefs_digital_Inclusion_March_2017.pdf">issue brief</a>, or <a href="https://internethealthreport.org/v01/digital-inclusion/">section of the Internet Health Report</a></i>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Web Literacy</strong> -- People everywhere should have the knowledge they need to tap into the full power of the Internet -- and to use it to make their lives and the world better. This means that everyone needs the skills to read, write and participate online. For this to happen, web literacy must be foundational in education, alongside skills like reading and math.
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Mozilla Network</strong> --  An influential network of people who understand that a healthy society relies on a healthy Internet. Members pool their expertise -- in technology, in advocacy, in education or in art -- to keep the Internet healthy.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Members of the Mozilla Network understand that three-and-a-half billion people -- and counting -- now live their lives on the Internet. We understand the opportunity the Internet unlocks -- and, conversely, the dangers of mass surveillance, insecurity and centralization. We understand that a positive future depends on a healthy Internet.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These fights will be fought across borders, in legislatures, at protests, online and in person. And they will influence everything from public policy to free expression and consumer technology. Now more than ever, we need a network.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>MozFest</strong>  -- The world's leading festival for the Internet Health movement. Three days each year, members gather together and discuss, debate, create and hack to build a better Internet. We’re a diverse crew: Scientists from the UK. Educators from Kenya. Technologists from Shenzhen.
      </p>

        <strong>Mark Surman</strong> -- The web is one of our most valuable public resources -- it’s Mark Surman’s job to protect it.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Mark is Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation, a global community that does everything from making Firefox to taking stands on issues like privacy and net neutrality. Mark’s main job is to build the movement side of Mozilla, rallying the citizens of the web, building alliances with likeminded organizations and leaders, and growing the open internet movement. Mark’s goal is nothing short of making the health and accessibility of the internet a mainstream issue around the world.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Mark has been doing work like this for 20 years: standing up for open source and putting technology into the hands of everyday people. Mark was the founding Director of telecentre.org, a $26M initiative connecting community technology centers in more than 30 countries. He ran the Commons Group for 10 years, a boutique consulting firm that provided advice and insight on networks, technology and social enterprise to nonprofits and governments around the world. Mark was awarded the prestigious Shuttleworth Foundation fellowship, where he explored how to apply open source approaches to philanthropy in the year before he joined Mozilla.
